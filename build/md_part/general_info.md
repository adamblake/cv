# Research Interests

## Self-assessment During Learning
What factors influence students' judgments and decisions about learning?
How do these factors inform us about the underlying mechanisms of
metacognition?

## Educational and Training Applications
What strategies do students adopt or endorse when approaching different
learning materials? How can instruction and learning materials improve
students' judgments of their own learning?
