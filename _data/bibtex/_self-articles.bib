abstract = {People are often exposed to more information than they can actually remember. Despite this frequent form of information overload, little is known about how much information people choose to remember. Using a novel “stop” paradigm, the current research examined whether and how people choose to stop receiving new—possibly overwhelming—information with the intent to maximize memory performance. Participants were presented with a long list of items and were rewarded for the number of correctly remembered words in a following free recall test. Critically, participants in a stop condition were provided with the option to stop the presentation of the remaining words at any time during the list, whereas participants in a control condition were presented with all items. Across five experiments, we found that participants tended to stop the presentation of the items to maximize the number of recalled items, but this decision ironically led to decreased memory performance relative to the control group. This pattern was consistent even after controlling for possible confounding factors (e.g., task demands). The results indicated a general, false belief that we can remember a larger number of items if we restrict the quantity of learning materials. These findings suggest people have an incomplete understanding of how we remember excessive amounts of information.},

abstract = {A current debate in metamemory research considers the roles of fluency (Rhodes {\&} Castel, 2008) and belief cues (Mueller, Dunlosky, {\&} Tauber, 2015) in the construction of judgments of learning (JOLs). Under the fluency hypothesis, the processing fluency drives the construction of JOLs. The belief-based hypothesis instead asserts a strong influence of belief. The current study directly influences participants' beliefs to observe the effects on metacognitive judgments of learning. Experiment 1A attempted to variably strengthen participants' beliefs about the font-size effect: participants were informed of research implying a superiority of large-fonts in memory and between study cycles were given differing levels of feedback on the relationship between font-size and their performance. A reliable replication of the font-size effect was found, though there were no appreciable differences due to feedback. Experiment 1B introduced a counter-belief that small-fonts are superior in terms of memory recall, and participants showed minimal effects of font-size on JOLs and none on memory. Finally, in Experiment 2 participants underwent a baseline condition with no belief manipulation and then an experimental condition that manipulated beliefs as in Experiments 1A and 1B. The results provide clear confirmatory evidence for the effects of belief on JOLs, though these data neither support a pure fluency hypothesis nor a pure belief-based hypothesis. We discuss an additive effect of perceptual fluency and belief on JOLs, and present possible mechanisms that may interact to influence and bias JOLs.},

abstract = {People are regularly bombarded with logos in an attempt to improve brand recognition, and logos are often designed with the central purpose of memorability. The ubiquitous Apple logo is a simple design, and is often referred to as one of the most recognizable logo s in the world. The present study examined recall and recognition for this simple and pervasive logo, and to what degree metamemory (confidence judgments) match memory performance. Participants showed surprisingly poor memory for the details of the logo as measured through recall (drawings) and forced-choice recognition. Only 1 participant out of 85 correctly recalled the Apple logo, and fewer than half of all participants correctly identified the logo. Importantly, participants indicated higher levels of confidence for both recall and recognition, and this overconfidence was reduced if participants made the judgments after, rather than before, drawing the logo. The general findings did not differ between Apple and PC users. The results provide novel support for theories of attentional saturation, inattentional amnesia, and reconstructive memory; additionally, they show how an availability heuristic can lead to overconfidence in memory for logos.},

abstract = {This article describes a new model for education research and development - the better book model - and reports on our initial development and application of the model in the context of introductory college-level statistics. The better book model leverages recent advances in technology that have made it possible to house learning materials such as textbooks online; to make them interactive (by including, for example, embedded formative assessments); to make them personalized so that different content can be given to different students; and to continuously update them based on data generated by students' interactions with the materials. Using these technologies - and applying the routines and methods of open-source software development and improvement science - we have developed a model in which a living textbook is continuously improved by a community of researchers, designers/developers, and instructors; and a technology platform (CourseKata.org) to support the collaborative improvement process. This model overcomes some of the obstacles that have slowed translation of research in the learning sciences into improved educational programs and materials.},

abstract = {Classroom audience response systems, in which students respond to class questions via a remote ‘clicker' unit, are widely used as a method for increasing student participation and providing immediate feedback in the form of a group frequency distribution. The phenomenon of social facilitation shows that task performance can be enhanced with co-action of others or with the presence of an audience. To enhance the audience effect, we employed a unique feedback system that displays each individual's response. After reading a text passage, participants responded via a remote clicker to a series of comprehension questions. Participants were provided with no feedback regarding other respondents' answers, group feedback, or individual feedback. The results demonstrated significantly higher test performance with individual response identification. Implications are discussed in terms of applied classroom settings and social facilitation with enhanced options for displaying different types of feedback with clickers during instruction.},
