abstract = {Introductory statistics should build knowledge that transfers to a richer understanding of statistics. Many students fail to realize the importance of variability in hypothesis testing after a formal course (Son et al., 2016), which may be due to emphasis on individual concepts (e.g., t-test, binomial distribution) rather than a coherent organization of the domain. In an interactive online textbook (Son {\&} Stigler, 2019), 1200+ embedded exercises help students practice connecting abstract core concepts (e.g., GLM, sampling distributions) and representations (e.g., notation, plots, R code) to model the data generating process. After a 10-week course, 258 students (repl. with 200) transferred their learning to multiple regression (not taught). The majority of students correctly extended GLM notation (78{\%}) and made correct predictions about R2 (83{\%}), SST (78{\%}), and SSE (85{\%}). They had difficulty interpreting coefficients (44{\%}). These patterns indicate understanding of statistical modelling that transfers to complex models with almost no further instruction. This kind of long-term learning is ostensibly the goal of instruction, but hard to study in the lab; our development of a new model of educational research is discussed.},
